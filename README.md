## The Original Flappy Bird

This is a non-profit fan tribute to the original Flappy Bird game that was developed by Vietnamese video game artist and programmer Dong Nguyen in 2013. Dong Nguyen is not affiliated with this creation in any way. No direct assets or code from the original game were used in this creation. The gameplay concept is also quite different since it's played in fully immersive 3D from the point of view of the bird.
